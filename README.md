# AR-Flood-Demo

A tool developed in Unity using models of Hurricane Sandy and presented via GIS.
The tool aids the visualization of floods in areas like New Brunswick, NJ.
This would help leaders and the community to come up with long term solution
and immediate decisions as another event of similar magnitude would happen in 
the future.
